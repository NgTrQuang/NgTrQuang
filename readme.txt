   Web App: Simple Authentication and Authorization with ReactJS

   REF:	https://www.bezkoder.com/react-hooks-jwt-auth/

   Notes to my students: 
      - The front-end app's layout is simple, just demonstrates about React hooks for JWT Authentication and shows product list.
      - You should separate the app into some DRY-components.
